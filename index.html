                             <p> while I was in Grade 11, I built an "artificial hemodialysis" model as part of a " biology project " at " festival Bonakan Hall "
                                 Using simple materials like containers, tubing, and water flow systems,
                                 I created a working demonstration of how dialysis helps clean blood in patients with kidney failure. I presented this project during the event,
                                  explaining the process to visitors and helping them understand how the system works.
                                  It was one of the first projects that made me excited about combining science, creativity, 
                                and hands-on building — and it inspired me to continue exploring technology in the years that followed</p>

                             <p> During my final year of high school,Grade 12,  I didn’t fully understand computers back then, but something about them pulled me in.
                                 I didn’t work on a  project that year — my focus was getting a strong final score to reach university. 
                                Alhamdulillah, I didn’t get the mark I dreamed of, but I still reached my goal. I got accepted into the Computer Science Department, 
                                just like I planned. That year taught me that it’s not about having a perfect path,
                                 it’s about staying focused and never letting go of what you really want </p>

                                I attended a festival as a project watcher, where I observed the creative work of students from our department.
                                 I learned some things about computers through the students who built projects in robotics and websites. 
                                Watching their work taught me a lot and inspired me. Even though I wasn’t presenting, we all received a reward for participating, </p>

                                 I’m continuing my journey in Computer Science and will become a second-year student at Salahaddin University.
                                 This year marks a big step forward for me, and I’m excited to keep learning and growing. </p>
